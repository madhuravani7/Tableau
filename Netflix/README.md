Netflix Dashboard - Netflix dataset analysis dashboard<br/><br/>
   Here, I visualized netflix dataset, and I must say i really liked visualizing it. I found the number of TV shows and movies released throughout the years, distribution of Movies and TV shows percentage, Ratings
   of different shows, top genres, best performing countries and created dynamic title and type search to find ratings, date added, year released, description, genre and more. It was quite fun.<br/><br/>
