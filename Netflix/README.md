Netflix Dashboard - Netflix dataset analysis dashboard<br/><br/>
In this project, I visualized a Netflix dataset using interactive dashboards. I analyzed the number of TV shows and movies released over the years, the distribution between content types, ratings across different shows, top genres, and the best-performing countries. Additionally, I implemented dynamic filters for title and content type, allowing users to explore details such as ratings, release year, date added, descriptions, and genres. This project was both insightful and enjoyable, and it highlighted the power of data visualization in uncovering entertainment trends.<br/><br/>
