Hey!
Checkout my Tableau Projects 👇

1. AirBnB Dashboard - Project 1
   I was able to display AirBnB data visually using Tableau. Such a great tool. I found how each bedroom type is performing in different areas and as whole that would surely help owners decide which house type does
   well, also figured price ranges by zipcode for different room types, found revenue over the year, distinct count of bedroom listings and much more. I surely liked working on this data set with Tableau.<br/><br/>
   Final Dashboard<br/><br/>
