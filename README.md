Hey!
Checkout my Tableau Projects ðŸ‘‡

1. AirBnB Dashboard - Project 1<br/>
   I was able to display AirBnB data visually using Tableau. Such a great tool. I found how each bedroom type is performing in different areas and as whole that would surely help owners decide which house type does
   well, also figured price ranges by zipcode for different room types, found revenue over the year, distinct count of bedroom listings and much more. I surely liked working on this data set with Tableau.<br/><br/>

2. Netflix Dashboard - Project 2<br/>
   Here, I visualized netflix dataset, and I must say i really liked visualizing it. I found the number of TV shows and movies released throughout the years, distribution of Movies and TV shows percentage, Ratings
   of different shows, top genres, best performing countries and created dynamic title and type search to find ratings, date added, year released, description, genre and more. It was quite fun.<br/><br/>
