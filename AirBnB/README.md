AirBnB Dashboard - AirBnB analysis dashboard<br/><br/>
   I utilized Tableau to create a comprehensive visual analysis of Airbnb data. The tool enabled me to uncover key insights, such as the performance of different room types across various regions and price ranges by zip code. I also analyzed annual revenue trends, the distribution of bedroom listings, and other valuable metrics. This analysis can support property owners in making informed decisions about which room types perform best in specific areas. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed exploring this dataset and leveraging Tableauâ€™s capabilities for data storytelling.<br/><br/>
